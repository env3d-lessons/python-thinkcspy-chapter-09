# Strings challenges

Here are some additional challenges on Python strings. Each function is
an independent exercise designed to test your application of loops and conditionals
as they apply to various aspects of strings such as indexing and slicing.

## User Interface

A graphical user interface is set up and you can run it by entering the command
`python main.py` in the terminal and following the prompts to open 
the browser. You can check each of your functions by providing different inputs.

## Automated Testing

You can check if you have gotten everything correct by running `pytest` in the terminal
before submitting.

## Submit

To submit, execute the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m 'submit'
git push
```
